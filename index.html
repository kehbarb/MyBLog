  <span><b>WHO IS TERRY,</b></span><br/>
  Terry Nyakio is a 21 year old lady born in Nairobi, Kenya. Growing up in Nairobi was the best part of my life as a kid until we moved to the coast in 2013. I was not supporting the idea of moving to the coast due to the difference in lifestyle, among other things. I thought of how I would have to adapt to their swahili accent 
  which is quite different from the one in Nairobi. All in all, if given lemons then make lemonade and turns out, coast is a very beautiful place. Living near Diani beach was actually a very great decision. 

  I am currently studying Bs in Information Technology at Zetech University, Thika Road Campus.
   Information Technology, IT, being a wide area has me being interested in Networking, Cybersecurity and Web development. I am glad to be studying at Zetech because there are many opportunities coming in for students.  We, for example, are able to participate in Huawei Certifications, Cisco Certifications and many others. The school is also very supportive in this things and I thank them for all the materials they provide us with.
  
  Terry loves listening to music, going to galleries and cinemas, travelling, reading and art. I love reading pacesetter which mostly have African-bases stories. I find such books interesting and filled with Africanicity. Take for example a book by the name - Nairobi Heat. I can confess to reading that book thrice by now. There a part where it talks about how one would pay house rent for as low as ksh 200, which is very fascinating
  fascinating for me for like right now house rent is above kshs 6000.
  Saying that I love going to cinemas will have you thinking that I like movies. And you are definitely thinking right. I love watching movies especially action, sci-fi and fiction. I thinking growing up as an only child really contributed to my love for movies and books as they were my only companion.
  I also love travelling because one gets to see the beautiful world we live in, not only in the people, but also in scenery among others. I personally appreciate nature whether it's in the night or during the day. Living in the coast has had me enjoying the white sandy beaches of Diani, eating tasteful seafood cuisines and enjoying the breeze from the Indian ocean. Am yet to visit other areas that have filled my bucket list.
  Listening to music is therapy. There are different types of music genres and I love afrobeats. Afrobeats is a music genre that involves the combination of West African musical styles (such as traditional Yoruba music and highlife) and American jazz, funk, and soul influences, with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion. The style was pioneered in the 1970s by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti, 
  who is responsible for popularizing the style both within and outside Nigeria. My favourite artist is Rema. He classifies his sound as afro-rave. Whenever I hear any of his songs, I begin to bump my head to the beats of the song without even knowing. I will even sing along to any of his songs. That's how much I love his songs. Here is my favourite song by Rema called Runaway.<br/>
